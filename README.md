# RazorPay Clone

## Project Overview

This project is a clone of the Razorpay website, created for the purpose of learning and practicing Tailwind CSS.

The goal is to replicate the basic UI elements of the Razorpay site while experimenting with Tailwind's utility-first CSS framework.

In this project, I aim to build responsive and visually appealing components using Tailwind CSS, as well as gain a deeper understanding of how to structure and style web applications efficiently.

## Features

- Fully responsive navbar with gradient background.
- Dynamic JavaScript integration for UI components.
- Tailwind CSS for rapid styling and layout.
- Basic structure and design of Razorpay's front-end interface.

## Tailwind CSS

This project heavily utilizes Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes to build custom designs without leaving your HTML.

Tailwind allows for fast and efficient styling directly within the HTML, enabling a modular approach to design.

## Why Tailwind CSS?

- Efficiency: No need to write custom CSS for most of the components.

- Responsive: Built-in classes for responsiveness and flexibility.

- Customizability: Easily extendable with custom configurations.

- Utility-first: No need to leave HTML to style elements.

## Learning Objectives

### This project is primarily designed to help me learn and experiment with:

- Tailwind CSS for utility-based styling.

- Building responsive designs without writing custom CSS.

- Creating reusable UI components.

- Dynamic DOM manipulation with JavaScript.
